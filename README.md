## 💼 Real Experience

I handled L2 support in a retail-based project in TCS. My role included monitoring, categorizing incidents, creating incidents as per user requirements, working on the incidents and assigning to the respected team back or resolving them and closing them when the user confirms and ensuring SLAs were met.
